##Graphic Update
* Integrate Bootstrap in calculate.html
* Integrate Bootstrap in calculate.cgi

##PHP Integration Test
* Try migrating calculate.html to PHP allowing to load modules / templates parts ( e.g menu)
* Load PHP template in cgi script?

##Functionality
* Add menu (Home / About / Contact)
* Add copyright (in footer)
* Prepare multiple formulas
* Integrate touch based menu

##Rewrite URLS
* Rewrite URL of script (/scgi-bin/calculate.cgi?it-gets-even-longer to something shorter

##Mobile Ad(s)
* Try loading an ad out of a database or file, and add advertizing to app. Pointless and evil, but a fun experiment.
