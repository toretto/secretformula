Secret Formula
=============

Secret Formula is an app which helps people to easily make (basic) calculations on their phone. 

##Goal
I'm using this app as an "exercise" to get back into developing. If my past failed attempts taught me anything, it's that I can't get anything done when I'm not working on something "concrete".

##Code
The app currently uses HTML, CSS, Python and PHP. This will evolve / change as my skillset and the knowledge of one (or all) of the languages changes.
