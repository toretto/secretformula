			<h4>2019 07 02</h4>
			<p>We had to make changes RE: our CSS, because it would break things in an upcoming version that'll be coming to smaller screens near you. We are making note of the fact that the app doesn't look fantastic on tablets</p>
			<p><strong>Today, we made the first build of the Android and Windows app. Spoiler: That's when the CSS decided not to play nice. Expect us to announce an Android version soon(ish)</strong></p>
			<h4>2019 05 12</h4>
			<p>We made changes in how input is processed, so that both the correct and the wrong way of writing decimals are accepted by the app.
				The right way, of course, is using the comma.</p>
				<p>We made a style change to the front-end of the app and made the button colors more consistant. Aren't you glad it only took us
					a year to to that?
				</p>
				<p><strong>Developers' note:</strong>I am trying to figure out how this app works so I can expand on it. Not working on it for over a 
				year might not have been the brightest idea.</p>
			</p>
			
			<h4>2018 04 26</h4>
			<p>A new formula has been added, which allows you to split the costs of items when some participanes only "used" the rental for a part of the time.
				E.G Someone joins you in your awesome cottage half-way the vacation, and you want to calculate the share he needs to pay.</p>
				<p>This was our most complex formula by far, for various reasons. It's also the hardest to explain the use off, but we hope that some of you find a use for it.</p>
			</p>
			<h4>2018 04 18</h4>	
			<p>Translation of the app into English is now complete. While translating we found a duplicate formula,
						which we converted to a new formula: You can now calculate the price without tax starting from a price
						that includes taxes or VAT. I mean, if you are into that sort of thing.
						<br/>
						We have also started working on a way to allow you to use both comma's and dots as decimale separators. As a result, the formula "Buy X, Get Y Free"
						will not be working under Microsoft Edge (it'll always return "0" as a result). This won't be fixed. Get your shit together, Edge.
					</p>
			<h4> 2018 04 16</h4>
		<p>We started translating the app to the Queens' language after giving up on the idea of building a language dictionary into the app. For now.</p>
		<h4> 2018 04 06</h4>
		<p>We made design changes so that the app is more "usable" on big screens (aka desktop devices) and immediately had to implement
			a fix because our buttons would become hard to read. We also ported the changes from the app to the web version so that absolute
			URL's are no longer being used.
		</p>
			<h4>2018 04 04</h4>
		<p>Well, it's been a while but we're back with some 'exciting' changes. (Let's be honest. You just want this thing to work)
		
		<ul>
			<li>We added a new formula, that helps you calcute fuel costs for a trip.</li>
			<li>We made changes to how the app laods CSS (Yet to be applied to all pages) so you don't need to load stuff from other parties. This makes things faster!</li>
			<li>We changed a class name to make future development simpler.</li>
			<li>We started working on an Apple / Android version!</li>
			<li>We've found ways to cut the time neede to add an formula in half.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>2017 10 14</h4>
		<p>Changes to button colors. Y'all better aprreciate them, I had to reinstall Coda2 to get this shit working. <em>It was awful</em></p>
		<p>Added a new formula, which calculates savings for a "Buy X, get Y (free)" promotions. Also tells you how much you'd be saving if you didn't fall for that promotion and just bought one item instead...</p>
		<h4>2017 10 12</h4>
		<p>Updated the main menu to reflect new features</p>
		
		<p>1.0.8 Added tip calculator with fixed rates - 0% to 25% - Support for rounding up final result is in the works.</p>
		<p>1.0.7c Reverting tip calculator to original; now specifically for "custom" tips</p>
		<p>1.0.7b Attempt to make tip calculator support fixed and custom rates.</p>
		<p>1.0.7a Launch of "tip calculator", which supports U.S Style of percentage based tips.</p>
		<h4> 2017 09 27</h4>
		<p> 1.0.5 Added "About Me" page and Update Page</p>
		<p>1.0.4 Added iOS icon for home screen. Check it out.</p>
		<p>1.0.3 Created home screen and backlinks on pages</p>
		<p>1.0.2 Fixed buttons and graphical glitches; added support for rounding decimals</p>
		<p>1.0.1 Changed formula for Discount si the result was no longer reversed. #Fail</p>
		<p>1.0.0 Decided to rewrite the web app using Javascript. Should make the app more "portable". Goodbye, Python, CGI-bin and the likes</p>
